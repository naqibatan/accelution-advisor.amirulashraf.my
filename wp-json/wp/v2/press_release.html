<p>
  Sunway Berhad (\u201cSunway\u201d or \u201cGroup\u201d) today announced its
  first quarter financial results for the financial year ending 31 December 2023
  (\u201cQ1 FY2023\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  The Group reported revenue of RM1,263.7 million for the current quarter ended
  31 March 2023, representing an increase of 13.6%, driven by higher
  contributions from most business segments except for construction and others
  segments. Profit before tax (\u201cPBT\u201d) rose 5.3% to RM192.0 million in
  Q1 FY2023 on the back of higher contributions from property investment and
  healthcare segments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  In accordance with MFRS 15, the property development profit from two of the
  Group\u2019s on-going property development projects in Singapore will only be
  recognised upon completion and handover of the projects. Hence, as at
  end-March 2023, the accumulated progressive profits related to these projects
  amounted to RM121.6 million is not yet recognised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Sunway Group chief financial officer, Chong Chang Choong commented, \u201cThe
  Group registered strong financial performance for the first quarter of 2023,
  better than the pre-pandemic period, anchored by sustained domestic economic
  growth. While there may be downside risks to the economic growth outlook, the
  Group has taken actions to make our business units more resilient to manage
  the headwinds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  He added, \u201cThe Group is cautiously optimistic that most of its business
  units will continue to perform satisfactorily. In particular, the Group
  expects its leisure, hospitality, and healthcare segments to continue to
  benefit from the improving in-bound leisure and medical-related tourism as
  more international airlines are resuming their flights to
  Malaysia.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","acf":{"news_date":"24

      Sunway Construction reported revenue of RM522.1 million in Q1 FY2023,
      compared to RM624.7 million in the corresponding quarter in the preceding
      year. Profit before tax (PBT) contracted from RM47.2 million in Q1 FY2022
      to RM37.5 million in the current quarter under review. The Group\u2019s
      revenue and PBT were softer on the back of lower contributions from the
      Construction segment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      For the quarter under review, the Construction segment recorded revenue
      and PBT of RM469.1 million and RM36.2 million respectively. The segment
      reported revenue and PBT of RM587.8 million and RM46.2 million
      respectively in the same quarter in the previous year. Revenue and PBT
      were higher in Q1 FY2022 due to the acceleration of construction progress
      to achieve project completion in the first half of 2022. In addition,
      project progress for the existing active projects has not picked up given
      that these projects are in the initial stage in the current

      increased in tandem from RM1.0 million in Q1 FY2022 to RM1.3 million in Q1
      FY2023. The improvement in the financial performance was buoyed by higher
      progress achieved for new projects. During the quarter, the Group
      commenced the operation of its new Integrated Construction Precast Hub
      (ICPH) in Singapore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          <p>
                            Sunway REIT started the financial year 2023 with a
                            steady financial performance. Revenue increased 19%
                            year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM182.8 million in Q1 2023,
                            attributable to the strong performance from the
                            Retail segment and resilient performance across all
                            segments. In addition, net property income (NPI) saw
                            a corresponding rise of 16% y-o-y to RM138.3 million
                            in Q1 2023 as compared to RM118.9 million in the
                            same quarter of the preceding year (Q1
                            2022).<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The Retail segment recorded revenue of RM126.3
                            million and NPI of RM90.0 million in Q1 2023,
                            representing an upsurge of 28% y-o-y, largely
                            contributed by the healthy growth across retail
                            properties, coupled with increased retail footfall
                            and encouraging retail sales during the festive
                            shopping period. The performance was further
                            supported by the strong growth momentum from Sunway
                            Pyramid Mall and the ramp-up business performance
                            from Sunway Carnival Mall following its opening of
                            the new wing in June 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Revenue and NPI for the Hotel segment stood at
                            RM18.5 million and RM17.5 million in Q1 2023
                            respectively, which maintained at the same levels as
                            Q1 2022. The performance was backed by the improved
                            average occupancy rate of 59% in Q1 2023 as compared
                            to 42% in Q1 2022, along with the encouraging
                            performance contributed by the re-opening of Sunway
                            Resort Hotel since May 2022. The solid performance
                            of the Hotel segment in Q1 2023 was obscured by the
                            absence of top-up of guaranteed NPI from Sunway
                            Lagoon Hotel in the same quarter of the preceding
                            year, which has since ceased. Overall, the
                            encouraging performance in Q1 2023 was also
                            predominantly supported by the arrival of domestic
                            and international tourists as well as the demand for
                            Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions
                            (MICE) activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          <p>
                            The Office segment recorded a moderate revenue
                            growth of 5% y-o-y to RM20.4 million, underpinned by
                            a stable average occupancy rate exceeding 80%. NPI
                            contracted marginally y-o-y from RM13.7 million to
                            RM13.5 million in Q1 2023, mainly due to the impact
                            of higher utility costs arising from the increase in
                            Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT).<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                            million on the back of annual rental reversion for

                            stable revenue of RM1.7 million in Q1 2023, with the
                            last rent review of Sunway REIT Industrial \u2013
                            Shah Alam 1 conducted in the corresponding quarter

                            financial performance for Q1 2023. The Retail
                            segment sustained its strong retail footfall and
                            retail sales momentum on the back of festive
                            spending.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                            growing economic headwinds and rising interest
                            costs, we are cautiously optimistic about the
                            outlook for 2023 as we closely monitor the evolving
                            market conditions and remain agile in responding to
                            emerging possibilities and

                            commitment to deliver value to our unitholders, we
                            have announced the proposed acquisition of six
                            hypermarkets in the current quarter, which is slated
                            for completion by the fourth quarter of 2023. We
                            remain steadfast in identifying and pursuing
                            potential opportunities that align with our values
